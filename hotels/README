Kaggle hotel sales competition.

New hotels in submission.csv

Hotel specifications in hotels.csv

Historical sales for all hotels except the new hotels in sales.csv in
September, October, November


Estimate sales for the new hotels for the first 10 days of December.

* Methods

** Overview

Design a predictor for the existing hotels.

Find cohorts in the existing hotels for the new hotels

Make predictions for the cohorts.

Scale their sales figures for the new hotels.

** More subtle

There are multiple sales per hotel per month.

Probably by destination country or city.

** Considerations

Hotel bookings are decided by:

Seasonality. We only have September to November. December is a
Christmas location.

Exchange rate.

Location.

And the other metrics: rates, category, ratings, reviews.



*** Data coverage

From sales. About half of the records are for hotels that have no
hotel records, so we can't even guess at the currency.

From hotels. There are 848 hotels that have no sales records (and are not
in the test set.)

From hotels there are 126 currencies (one null).

From sales there are 123 currencies.

From submissions there are only 76 currencies.
