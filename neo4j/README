* Preamble

weaves

* Installation

neo4j provide a Debian sources.list file and an key for APT.

** j1 neo4j server

Now runs out of a thin volume /dev/TMP0/neo4j
This is the whole /var/lib/neo4j directory

Using the standard systemd script. Added plugins and logging in the /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf.

* Usage

** Basic access to neo4j - initial web console

The default username is neo4j 

The default URL for web-access is http://localhost:7474/browser/ on
initialization it asks for a password for the neo4j user. It opens on a TCP port
which can be 0.0.0.0. Other ports are named in the /etc/neo4j.conf file. The
port number for bolt is 7687

** Access via command-line shell

The new shell is cypher-shell (j1 only)

 $ cypher-shell -u neo4j -p abc123

or whatever the password is, if not on command-line, it will prompt.

The old shell (Debian provided) is on n1 installed as neo4j-client and is invoked as

 $ neo4j-client -u weaves j1.host

This connects.

** Web-console

To display graph diagrams, just paste a generic command into the console

 $ MATCH p=(:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie) RETURN p

And the web-console will plot up to a limit.

** NeoViz

The index.html file shows how to use https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neovis.js

Paste the same query into the config block as the value for 'initial_cypher'.
Adjust the labels: to be the Node classes. Similarly for relationships.




** j1 Python notebooks

These use the py2neo package - installed in gensim.

See /misc/build/0/training-v2/Courses/DataScience/notebooks/

All these work, but when running, don't use the Sandbox cell.

** Plugins (and logging)

Drop plugins in the /var/lib/neo4j/plugins
Change /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf security.procedures to include
algo.* in the whitelist and the unrestricted

  dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=algo.*
  dbms.security.procedures.whitelist=randomUUID,algo.*,apoc.coll.*,apoc.load.*

I've added the open source graph algorithms algo.* and the apoc.* loaders

To check the web-interface has

 call algo.list()

To see APOC is loaded use the auto-complete on this

 call apoc

Just to check, the logging was switched on.
