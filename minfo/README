This package provides the Python script 'minfo' that uses a local
module MInfo1 to extract information from media files. 
This is then used to produce a chapters file for MP4Box to produce an Apple
audiofile (an .m4b) that can be a full audiobook with chapters.

To develop the package, you need to put some media files (mp3 or m4a) into minfo/tests/media
(a link will do.)

Put a list of those files (absolute paths) into minfo/tests/p1.lst

There is a README.md in minfo/. That gives advice on packages to install.

Stop press: there was a problem with unicode strings, but that has gone away.
