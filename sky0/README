Sky Data Analysis Programming Assignment
v3.5 10/06/2019 (created 11/10/2012)

The .py scripts all run from the (Unix shell) command-line. They rely on the
CSV file 200606.csv being in the same directory. The output files are q1.txt,
q2.txt and q3.txt.

The files have to run in this order. The first script writes a Pickle that the
next two scripts use.
