Using the Gmusic API as a test project.

* Running

Debugging is tricky because it is a test case. 

** Command-line

To run from the command-line under unittest.

 $ python -m unittest GMus0TestCase

** Within Emacs

Under Emacs using ipython, the ipython parameters are passed to the
unittest.main(sys.argv). So there is some side-stepping code in the
GMus0TestCase file now.

Use the send buffer method of the Python IDE. Do not make it dedicated.
Then enter the test0.py buffer and send the unittest.run commands.

You can then access the object via the GMus0TestCase module.

The variables and the objects can then be accessed via the
GMus0TestCase class's variables.
