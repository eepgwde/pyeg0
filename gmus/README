Using the Gmusic API as a test project.

Debugging is tricky because it is a test case. 
Under emacs, start ipython, but don't pass --pylab or --colors=Linux

Then, in the interpreter, nothing has been loaded, so 

 run test0.py

# message is zero tests run

 unittest.main()

# runs the tests

The variables and the objects can then be accessed via the
GMus0TestCase class's variables.
