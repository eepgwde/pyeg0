    "So looking at the near window results. After notifications, of 9240 users, 67% responded in such a way that their average days between transactions was reduced; 3 months + 10 days before, 1520 of the 9240 who responded after, only 37% transacted in the 3 month period in such a way that they reduced their transaction-day rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that is so conclusive that there is no need to put it to a statistical test, which would be a Chi-square of log-likelihood on a 3-way contingency table with the pre results as the expected and post as the observed.\n",

    "From this preliminary investigation, it's clear without a statistical test that the Reengagement notification has had the desired effect: users have logged proportionally more transaction days.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are further investigations that could be conducted. The \"pre\" or before notifications control group (expected counts) could be tabulated differently as noted in the conclusion above.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be worthwhile carrying ut the analysis using a different measure from transaction-days. The number of transactions could be used and also the value or volume of transactions could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also this analysis has only used on the counts of the transaction-days rate that have decreased. It could also address the average change in magnitude of the average transaction-days rate - a regression analysis.\n",
